When people want to donate money for a project that could be used in Charity, Environmental purpose, opening of hospital and many other social areas, they are unsure if the money is in safe hands and not be being routed to a different area.

This is where blockchain technology comes into the picture and it helps with transparency of the system. 

CrowdFunding is the process of collecting money from people for a company, charity, hospital or a different purpose. 

In this project we have introduced a target amount to be collected from the people, a deadline within which the amount should be collected and minimum conntribution by a contributor.

There could be more than one project for which funds are required. Like Charity, Hospital and Environment. The contributors vote for the project for which they feel funds should be contributed. The project which has more than 50% of the votes from the contributors is chosen for donation of funds by the contributors.

If the target amount is not fulfilled within the deadline, then the contributors can ask for a refund of their money. Like if 100,000 USD is to be collected in a month and only 90,000 USD could be collected, then a contributor could ask for a refund of his funds.
